# EECEï¼šEfficient and effective counterfactual explanations for random forest

Random forests are widely used in machine learning due to their excellent predictive performance. However, their complexity often hinders interpretability, making it challenging for users to understand the decision-making process. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)  techniques aim to mitigate this issue by enhancing model transparency. Among these techniques, counterfactual explanations provide intuitive insights by describing the minimal modifications needed to achieve a desired outcome. In this paper, we propose an approach called Efficient and Effective Counterfactual Explanation (EECE) for random forests, which generates counterfactual explanations by leveraging the structure of decision tree leaves. EECE not only ensures efficient explanation generation but also satisfies key properties essential for high-quality counterfactual explanations. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we compare EECE with existing methods across 15 datasets using multiple evaluation metrics.
